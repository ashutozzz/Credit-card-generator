# Credit-card-generator
 This project is a simple credit card input form built using React. It allows users to enter their credit card details, including the card number, cardholder name, expiry month and year, and CVC. The form performs basic validation to check if the required fields are filled and if the input format is correct for the card number, expiry date, and CVC
